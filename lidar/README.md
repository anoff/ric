### Digital Infrared Referee for R.I.C.

Placed Vertically in front of our R.I.C. System, the referee measures the reaction time and also makes sure that the next iteration of the game will only be started once the players hand is completely removed from the game area.

> Note: In order to discover the RPLIDAR sensor on your COM ports, you need to install the driver.
